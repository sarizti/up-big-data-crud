Useful commands
---------------

Sometimes you need to execute commands in the pipenv directly instead of using the IDE gui. Open the terminal and use

```sh
pipenv shell
```

Django needs some db tables to make its own administration, just run migrate to make the initial setup.

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

Sometimes this package is out of date in python installations, so the America/Mexico_City timezone is not found.

```sh
pip install pytz tzdata --upgrade
```

If for whatever reason you don't have pipenv installed, use this

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pipenv
```
If your PyCharm project didn't recognize this as a django project, then the green
"play" button in the toolbar might not work for starting your django app. Then you
can manually run the script to start the app in the browser with:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

SQL Scripts
-----------

After the initial migrate command, you should see the `db.sqlite3` file in your project files. If not, refresh the view.
Double-click the file. It should be added as a data source in the database section.

For this course, we need to have the tables found in `campus/sql`, so open those files and execute them in the sqlite
database that the `migrate` command created: `db.sqlite3`.
